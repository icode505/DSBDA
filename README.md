Heatmap : is defined as a graphical representation of data using

colors to visualize the value of the matrix.

A heatmap give a plot of matrix values as a matrix of color-encoded

values. As parameter it takes a 2D dataset

Heatmaps in Seaborn can be plotted by using the seaborn.heatmap()method.
